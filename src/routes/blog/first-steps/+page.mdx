Hey everyone!

First off, welcome to our first blog post & welcome to the site, if you’re a first-time visitor! I just wanted to write detailing our mission, the beginning of our services, & what is happening regarding Fosshost tenants.

We’re the Radix Project, and we exist to provide tailored cloud hosting services to open source projects & organizations that represent the ideals of the open source community. We use what our generous donors provide us with to offer these services to as many organizations & projects as possible. Our best in class team is expanding slowly but surely as we gain momentum & we have already been approached by dozens of projects we’d like to be able to help in the near future.

Right now, we are working with Fosshost to transfer as much of their infrastructure to our project as possible as they sunset their hosting services to transition their operations. Our number one goal is helping the community, and Fosshost has been very supportive in our efforts to do so. From speaking with them, they understand that sometimes things don’t work out exactly the way everyone plans, and they have been instrumental in helping us begin our journey to serving open source. I am very grateful for how helpful they have been, & their generous offer to help get us started as they watch the sun set on their past as a hosting provider.

If you are currently a Fosshost tenant, you should evacuate your operations from Fosshost’s infrastructure as soon as possible. We will need time to work out the future of our services & how it relates to maintaining your projects, but we will have a two week grace period where Fosshost tenants will be able to move before servers are wiped. This does not start now; we will let you know very publicly when this grace period begins. You will have to reapply to use our services after this deadline. This is to ensure you are able to contemplate the future of your project as it pertains to what we can provide. If you have any concerns about the nature of this transition, you can read our Privacy Policy or reach out to us directly for more info.

We are looking forward to helping as much as we can in the near future. I would like to personally thank Fosshost CEO Thomas Markey for working extensively with me to help the Radix Project out as Fosshost embarks on their new journey. We are trying to move as quickly as we can to do as much good as possible, as soon as possible. You can email us at contact@radixproject.org, keep up with us at https://masto.ai/@radix, & meet our community at <a href="https://chat.radixproject.org">chat.radixproject.org</a>. We’ll be taking on more volunteers in the near future, and if you’re interested, shoot us an email. Thank you so much for your interest in our services, and we will have more to show very soon!

Best,<br>
Gianni Rosato<br>
CEO of the Radix Project
