# Privacy Policy

The Radix Project strives to collect as little data from everyone involved as possible. Casual site visitors at https://radixproject.org are kept track of anonymously via self-hosted Plausible Analytics.

The privacy of our website visitors is important to us so we do not track any individual people. As a visitor to https://radixproject.org:

- No identifying personal information is collected
- No information such as cookies is stored in the browser
- No information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties
- No information is shared with advertising companies
- No information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends
- No information is monetized

We run the [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) script to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected.

Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more. You can see full details in Plausible’s data policy.

Because our instance is self-hosted, under no circumstances will any of this data be shared with third parties. We are also GDPR, CCPA, & cookie law compliant due to the fact that we do not employ the use of cookies on this site.

From partner applicants & partners, we require the most basic data to keep our gears turning. This includes:
- Your full name and/or the name of your organization
- Your email address
- The country you live in
- The project you are affiliated with & that project’s needs
- The organization you claim to be affiliated with (if applicable)

All of this information is provided voluntarily by applicants who wish to become partners, and is stored in order to ensure we understand our partners & their needs. Any further information provided to us by partners is provided on a voluntary basis.

Information we require from prospective volunteers is on a per-application basis, and will depend on the volunteer position you are applying for. Volunteers provide this information voluntarily, and we store this information to understand our volunteers better. More information about what we store from prospective volunteers can be seen via our volunteer application process. A sample of the information we collect is:
- Your full name
- Your email address
- The country you live in
- Your previous work experience
- Health-related concerns that may make for a hazardous workplace
- Information collected via the interview process, induction, & training

This information is stored by us only. We will never share the above information with any unauthorised parties. The only authorised parties affiliated with our volunteer application process are legal consultants & our outsourced background checking service.

We will comply with the law & share any data necessary in the event of a subpoena, legal request or any other matter where the law dictates we share our information with the authorities.

You may submit a request at any time if you wish for us to provide all data that we hold on you.
